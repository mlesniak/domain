# Hello, world!

This is the homepage of Dr. Michael C. Lesniak. Currently, you won't  find a lot of content here, since it serves primarily as a testbed for playing with different client and server technologies.

Nevertheless, if you have any questions, feel free to write me a [mail](mailto:mail@mlesniak.com) or contact me on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/mlesniak).
